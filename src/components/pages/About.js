            <p id="bio">Hi. I'm an Information Technology graduate student at the <a href="https://manchester.unh.edu/">University of New Hampshire at Manchester</a>. Over the past few years I've become especially interested in pursuing web development. I enjoy using Python and React to make my ideas come to life. I'm currently working as a freelance front-end web developer while I complete my final year of school.</p>
